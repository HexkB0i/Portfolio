# Ollie's Front-end Portfolio

## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Ollie and I am an up-and-coming Front-end developer. I am aspiring to build a career in software engineering and for that purpose I am creating this repo as a portfolio of my practice works. Whether you are a client that would like to hire me for a freelance gig or a recruiter looking for a new addition to the team you are welcome to have a look at my work!

*Thank you!*
